 - Integers and real values (floats) are represented as you would expect  
 - Strings are as well, except they require single quotes
	 - Two single quotes = one real quote  
>[!example]
>```SQL
> 'Joe''s Bar' = Joe's Bar  
>```
- Any value can be NULL   
	 - For now, we will learn later how this can be prevented
